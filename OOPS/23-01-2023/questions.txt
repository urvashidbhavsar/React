What is class?
-> class is collection of data. 

syntax : 
    class class_name{
        constructor(parameter){   // directly pass function_name

        }
    }

    var class_disp = new class_name();

what is prototype?
-> it is in-built object functionality.

syntax :
fullName => create randomly name

class_name.prototype.fullName = function(){
    return statements;
}

what is inheritance??
-> functionality received from parent class.

class a{
    constructor(fn, ln){

    }
}
class b{
    a.call() -> it perform interitance in class
    constructor(fn,ln,sal){

    }
}

what is encapsulation??
-> bind data / wrap data
-> use getter and setter method.
-> use get and set word before function/methods.

what is static method ??
-> used static keyword to make static method.
-> always created in class.
-> not used in object.

what is polymorphism??
-> many form.
-> create function with same name but different signature / parameter.
-> extends keyword to make interitance - polymorphism.
